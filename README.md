## Project Description

In the web project, the user logs in to Spotify. According to the emotions being detected by the user, a personalized song recommendation list is provided through Spotify API via ChatGPT, showing the details of the song on an accordant screen. Thereafter, users can create a playlist of suggested songs and push it directly into their Spotify account.
